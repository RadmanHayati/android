    **SOLID** is a mnemonic acronym that helps define the five basic **object-oriented design** principles:
    
    - Single Responsibility Principle
    - Open-Closed Principle
    - Liskov Substitution Principle
    - Interface Segregation Principle
    - Dependency Inversion Principle
    
    ## **SOLID #1: The Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**
    
    > A class should have one, and only one, reason to change.
    > 
    
    ## **SOLID #2: The Open-Closed Principle (OCP)**
    
    > Software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc…) should be open for extension, but closed for modification
    > 
    
    ## **SOLID #3: The Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**
    
    > Child classes should never break the parent class’ type definitions.
    > 
    
    ## **SOLID #4: The Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**
    
    > The interface-segregation principle (ISP) states that no client should be forced to depend on methods it does not use.
    > 
    
    ## **SOLID #5: The Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**
    
    > 1. High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions\. 2. Abstractions should not depend upon details. Details should depend upon abstractions.
